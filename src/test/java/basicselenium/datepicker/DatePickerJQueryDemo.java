/*
* Approaches
* 1. Put date using sendkeys directly(not applicable
* always)
* 2. Selecting date dynamically at runtime
* a. Locate datepicker and click
* b. Get month, year and date in a variable and compare it with month, yr and date present in calendar
* For this comparison, start a while loop and in it store  values for month and year on each iteration
* inside loop at one if block and keep comparing date and month. 
* After comparing the date and month, keep clicking next button for next month
